## General

This is a Python client library for [News API V2](https://newsapi.org/).
The functions and methods for this library should mirror the
endpoints specified by the News API [documentation](https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints).

## Installation

Installation for the package can be done via `pip`:

```bash
$ python -m pip install newsapi-python
```

## Usage

After installation, import the client class into your project:

```python
from newsapi.newsapi_client  import NewsApiClient
```

Initialize the client with your API key:

```python
api = NewsApiClient(api_key='XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX')
```

### Endpoints

An instance of `NewsApiClient` has three instance methods corresponding to three News API endpoints.

#### Top Headlines

Use `.get_top_headlines()` to pull from the [`/top-headlines`](https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/top-headlines) endpoint:

```python
api.get_top_headlines(sources='bbc-news')
```

#### Everything

Use `.get_everything()` to pull from the [`/everything`](https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything) endpoint:

```python
api.get_everything(q='bitcoin')
```

#### Sources

Use `.get_sources()` to pull from the [`/sources`](https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/sources) endpoint:

```python
api.get_sources()
```

## For Windows users printing to _cmd_ or _powershell_

You will encounter an error if you attempt to print the .json() object to the command line. This is because the '{', '}' curly braces to be printed to the console.
This becomes especially annoying if developers wish to get 'under the hood'.

Here is the error:

```
UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode character '\u2019' in position 1444: character maps to <undefined>
```

This can be fixed by:
    - installing 'win-unicode-console'
        `py -mpip install win-unicode-console`
    - then running it while calling your python script...
        `py -mrun myPythonScript.py`

Another option is hardcoding your console to only print in utf-8. This is a bad idea, as it could ruin many other scripts and/or make errors MUCH more difficult to track.
